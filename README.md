# 82000

What is the next number in the sequence 2, 3, 4, 82000, ...?  It is a well defined sequence, but it may or may not have a 5th number!

To learn how the sequence is defined, see http://andybohn.com/82000/

For an overview of how this code searches for the next number: http://andybohn.com/82000-2/

Finally, code details, scaling, and performacnce can be found here: http://andybohn.com/82000-3/

As of October 20, 2015, I have checked numbers with less than 27.5 million digits and have not found the next number.

## TODO list:

* Specify options such as min base, max base, and starting number on
  the command line or in an input file
* Print maximum number checked instead of the number that the master thread
  has just finished checking
